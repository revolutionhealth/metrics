== Introduction

This gem provides a metrics collecting for controllers, database queries, 
and specific blocks of code or methods.  It is designed to be light-weight 
and have minimal impact on production builds while providing preformance 
indicators of the running application.

== Disclaimer


This software is released to be used at your own risk.
For feedback please drop us a line at rails-trunk [ at ] revolution DOT com.

Using this plugin should not be your first step in application 
optimization/scaling or even the second one. 

== Example

class SomeClassToTest
  collect_metrics_on :my_method

  def my_method(blah = nil)
    true
  end
end

for more samples and test cases see:  test/metrics_test.rb 

=== Usage

The metrics are written to:  logs/<environment>_metrics.log

Configuration can be updated in: metrics/config/metrics.yml, you may
copy this file to your RAILS_ROOT/config/metrics.yml and customize for 
your application, the RAILS_ROOT will be checked first.
